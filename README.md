# Parenthood is a simple choice-based game made with unity. The game is about a single father who must
# navigate the struggles of raising a child after his wife died. Using dialogue options, the player
# must decide how to raise their child - some will be naturally inclined to coddle their daughter, 
# while others may want to toughen her up. Your decisions will affect the ending of the game.

# Build1.exe is built and run version of the game
